# CarDatabase

By: Josh Mansito and Tina Hunyh

IMPORTANT: 
- Please name your database HW2 in PHPMyAdmin so that the php code works properly.
- You may need to rename CarDatabase-Master to Homework2, or change the route appropriately.
- Folder goes directly into XAMPP > xamppfiles > htdocs 
- The code is routed: http://localhost:8080/Homework2/RentalWebsite/index.php
- The code is set up to be deployed through heroku, however, I was not able to get an account made through PHPMyAdmin,
  so please use localhost.
